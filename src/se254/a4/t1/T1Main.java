/**
 * SE254 Assignment 4 Task 1 Main - Instructions 
 * 
 * This class should be implemented to accept the user input 
 * through args[] and delegate the reflection functionality to class Reflector. 
 * 
 * You may implement additional classes if you wish, but this class should be the main program entry
 * point.
 * 
 * You must STAGE, COMMIT and PUSH your changes everytime you are 
 * "done" (see the "definition of done" in Agile/Scrum/XP) with writing/changing this class, i.e. 
 * after successfully completing Task 1, Task 2 and Task 3, respectively
 * You may COMMIT and PUSH prematurely too i.e. before each task is completed, but 
 * you "must" COMMIT and PUSH to the remote repo after finishing each of the A4 tasks.
